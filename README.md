Air Canvas Project
Overview
The Air Canvas project is an innovative tool that allows users to draw on a virtual canvas in real-time using simple hand gestures. By utilizing a webcam and computer vision techniques, this project tracks hand movements and translates them into digital drawings, offering an interactive and fun way to create art without traditional tools.

Features

Real-Time Hand Tracking: Tracks the user's hand gestures using a webcam.
Virtual Drawing: Enables drawing on a canvas without physical contact.
Color Selection: Offers multiple colors for drawing by recognizing specific gestures or key presses.
Brush Size Control: Allows adjusting the brush size dynamically.
Eraser Mode: Includes a feature to erase parts of the drawing.
Save Artwork: Option to save the drawing as an image file.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
OpenCV (for real-time video processing)
Mediapipe (for hand detection and tracking)
NumPy (for canvas manipulation)
Hardware:
Webcam (for capturing hand gestures)



How to Use

Ensure your webcam is connected and functioning.
Launch the project using the command above.
Move your hand within the webcam's view:
Drawing: Use your index finger to draw.
Change Color: Perform the designated gesture for color selection or use a specific key.
Eraser Mode: Activate eraser mode using a gesture or key press.
Save your drawing by pressing the save key (if implemented).
Future Enhancements
Add gesture-based undo and redo functionality.
Enhance gesture recognition accuracy.
Introduce support for multiple canvas sizes.
Implement shape-drawing tools (e.g., circles, rectangles).
